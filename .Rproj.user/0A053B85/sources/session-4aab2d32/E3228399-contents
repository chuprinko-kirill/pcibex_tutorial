# Preface {#sec-preface .unnumbered}

<p>In this tutorial we will discuss how to run experiments on the online platform [PCIbex](https://www.pcibex.net/). We will discuss how to upload stimuli, do proper code for your research, share an experiment and download results. We will look in details at two experimental techniques with online measurements: self-paced reading task (sprt for short) and speeded grammaticality judgement (sgj).</p>
<p>All discussed templates are available at the GitHub repository of this tutorial.</p>
